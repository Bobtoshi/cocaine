Hey! Here's how to get started mining COCAINE on Windows:

📥 DOWNLOAD (No compilation needed!):
1. Go to: https://github.com/Bobtoshi/cocaine/releases/latest
2. Download: cocaine-windows-x64.zip
3. Extract it somewhere (like C:\cocaine)

🚀 QUICK START:
1. Open Command Prompt in the extracted folder
2. Start your local daemon (this syncs from my VPS):
   cocained.exe --data-dir C:\ProgramData\cocaine --rpc-bind-ip 127.0.0.1 --rpc-bind-port 19081 --p2p-bind-ip 127.0.0.1 --p2p-bind-port 19080 --add-exclusive-node 138.68.128.104:19080 --log-level 1

3. Wait for it to sync (you'll see "Synchronizing with the network...")

4. In a NEW terminal, create your wallet:
   cocaine-wallet-cli.exe --generate-new-wallet mywallet --password "" --mnemonic-language English --daemon-address 127.0.0.1:19081
   
   ⚠️ SAVE YOUR SEED PHRASE! This is your only backup.

5. Once synced, start mining:
   curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:19081/start_mining -d "{\"miner_address\": \"YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS\", \"threads_count\": 2, \"do_background_mining\": false, \"ignore_battery\": true}" -H "Content-Type: application/json"

Replace YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS with your actual wallet address.

Key points:
- Mining happens on YOUR computer (not my VPS)
- My VPS is just for blockchain sync
- No compilation needed - just download and run!
